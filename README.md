# Automatic-Instrument-Identification
Automatic musical instrument recognition of monophonic and monotimbral music instruments sound signals. Instrument recognition is done using classification techniques. <br />
In particular, the developed method taking into 7 instrumental categories including Cello  (889 samples), Clarinet (846 samples), Flute (878 samples), Guitar (106 samples), Saxophone (732 samples),Trumpet (485 samples), Violin (1502 samples). <br />
